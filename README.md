# NTPG Parser
Parses and repacks NTPG files commonly found on the Nintendo DS.

## What is an NTPG file
Maybe someone who knows the DS more can explain, but I found literally nothing online about this format. 
It is very similar to BRLYTs found on the Nintendo Wii, so I assume it is a layout file. 
This tool was created out of necessity for translating and packing the Dokodemo Wii no Ma manual.
